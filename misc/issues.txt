1. When using the Rainbow CSV "align" feature in VSCode, the formatting script can fail.
   Do not align any data that needs to be processed
   
2. When running "setup.sh", you need to source it (source .setup/setup.sh)

3. Run all scripts ("download", "format", "train", "test") inside of their directories, do not run them outside of their directories or they will fail

4. yfinance version 0.2.51 destroyed functionality for obtaining news from a yf.Ticker() object. Possibly fix this later?
